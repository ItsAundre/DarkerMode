            Welcome, to DarkerMC.
            This is a 1-person project and is actively being sustained.
            If you download and use my texture-pack, that's enough support.
            But please, if you use this in a video, do credit me. (JustAundre)
            Thanks for reading, if you'd like,
          </p>
